The tricky thing is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:\n * on every year that is evenly divisible by 4\n * except every year that is evenly divisible by 100\n * unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400\n \nFor example, 1995 is not a leap year, but 1996 is. 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.\n\n**(b)** Test your function on some selected years that allow you to check if it provides the correct solution.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Exercise 3 - Rigged dice\n\n**(a)** Create a rigged dice function that 25% of the time returns the number 6.

You do not need to check that numbers 1 to 5 are returned uniformly or randomly, but you need to check that your function returns integers in the range 1-6 (inclusive).

Unfortunately, Elliot made some errors while creating the function. The function `check_alive` should return a _boolean_, which has true value if the player's health is greater than 0 and false value if it is 0 or below. The function receives one parameter, `health`, which will always be a whole number between `-10` and `10`.\n\n**(a)** Fix the function by correcting Elliot's mistakes.\n\n**(b)** Write a test to make sure that after your changes the function indeed does what it should. \n\n_CAREFUL: you cannot use the same condition in the function and in the test!
